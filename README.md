# PretendCity-Children-Museum-Analysis-only-using-Seasonal-and-Trend-to-Forecast

In this project, we will be forecasting attendence for a non-profit organization based in Irvine that aims to promote child-development. We hope to provide management insights on their data so they can adjust their resources accordingly and prevent unnecessary costs. 

The data used in this project is the Monthly attendence of the non-profit organization. The data contains daily ticket entries excluding entries from birthday parties and field trips (Attendence), if it is federal holiday (Fed Holiday), if the day is a Saturday or Sunday (Weekend), and if the museum is closed (Closed). Data is collected from it's opening day, September 1st 2009, until present, January 20th 2019.
